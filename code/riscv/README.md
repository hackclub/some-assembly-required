# RISC-V

### Code Examples

- [RISC-V example](/code/riscv/riscv.s)

---

There are many different assembly languages, depending on the processor you want to talk to.

**RISC-V** is a simpler assembly language, made for educational and research purposes. RISC stands for "Reduced Instruction Set Compiler". Its goal is to use a smaller instruction set than most other assembly languages. RISC-V is 8-bit, meaning the registers hold 8 bits.

## Running programs

To run [our RISC-V code](/code/riscv/riscv.s), you can paste the file contents into a RISC-V interpreter, like https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3410/2019sp/riscv/interpreter/.
