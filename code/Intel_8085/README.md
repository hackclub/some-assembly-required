<p align="justify">If you are someone who is getting starte with Assembly Level Programming, probabaly Intel 8085 Microprocessor is best for you. It is an 8-bit microprocessor designed by Intel in 1977 using NMOS technology. It was introduced in March 1976. It was an update of 8080 microprocessor. The 8080 Processor was updated with Enable/Disable instruction pins and Interrupt Pins to form the 8085 microprocessor.</p><br><br>
It has following configuration :-
<ul>
    <li>8-bit data bus</li>
    <li>16-bit address bus</li>
    <li>16-bit program counter</li>
    <li>6 8-bit registers arraged in pairs: BC, DE, HL</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p align="justify">It has a 40-pin dual in line package. The Address and Data bus are multiplexed in this processor which helps in providing more control signals. It has 1 non-maskable interrupt and 3 maskable interrupts. it provides serial interfacing w9ith Serial Input Data (SID) and Serial Output Data(SOD).<br><br></p>
